RSC Sundae üç®
==========

https://git.sr.ht/~stormy/rscsundae

RSC Sundae is a simple, single-threaded RS Classic server emulator
written in C99.  It is based on clean-room reverse engineering and
contains no copyrighted source code.  For content scripting, it
features an implementation of the original RuneScript API in Lua
based on public documents.

It was inspired by the RSC-C client's lack of a native server.
Since RSC-C runs on old and low-power mobile devices, RSC Sundae
should target similar devices.

An initial target for RSC Sundae should be to accurately replicate
all RS Classic content from the final F2P-only version of the game
(10th December 2001), since lots of preserved data exists for this
revision.  This should be accomplished using the original game's
unmodified free data files.  By using the same API and data sources as
the original game, the hope is that it becomes more difficult to
implement content inaccurately.

For clients, RSC Sundae supports the 110 protocol (the original
Java mudclient110 from December 2001), and the 204 protocol
(the final version of RSC before "Retro Revival" in 2009, used
by RSC-C, and STS).

RSC Sundae will never support:

* Multiple threads
* Protocol versions beyond 204
* Protocol versions with the "spook cipher"
* Custom private server protocols or data formats
* Integration with proprietary services like Discord

Building
--------

RSC Sundae is developed on NetBSD. I occasionally test it on
Mac OS X 10.4 and Alpine Linux. If I break something on another
UNIX-like platform, please send a patch.

Dependencies:

* BZip2 (for decompressing Jagex Archives to load the original game data)
* Lua 5.4 (for running content scripts)
* libev (for the event loop; optional - mostly for macOS and Windows)
* inih (for parsing the configuration file)
* libcrypto from OpenSSL (for RSA decryption, and random number generation on some systems)
* SQLite3 (for player save file persistence)
* Argon2 (for secure password storage)

On Debian Linux and derivatives, install the following:

	build-essential pkgconf libbz2-dev liblua5.4-dev libinih-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libargon2-dev

On Alpine Linux, install the following:

	build-base pkgconf bzip2-dev lua5.4-dev inih-dev openssl-dev sqlite-dev argon2-dev

Run `./configure && make -j2` to build the server.

Contributing
------------

Read `doc/style.md` first.

Use `git format-patch`. You can email `stormy@mailfence.com`.

Fuzzing & profiling
-------------------

Sundae is wired up for performance profiling with gperftools and fuzzing
with AFL.

For profiling, configure with:

	CFLAGS="-DPROFILE" LDFLAGS="-lprofiler" ./configure

For fuzzing, configure with:

	CC=afl-gcc \
	CFLAGS="-DFUZZ -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all -fsanitize=undefined" \
	LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=undefined" ./configure

Credits
-------

* Stormy wrote the bulk of the engine and most of the content.
* Mister Hat (frogdoubler) contributed player persistence support via SQLite,
  and the Vampire Slayer quest.
* Zachary Penn (Hikilaka) contributed many enhancements to the scripting API,
  teleportation spells, mixing dyes and capes, player variables support.
* Pazaz served as an influence with their 2004scape project, listened to
  a lot of my theorizing, and helped answer obscure RS questions.
* Protosstribe got me interested in reverse engineering old clients.
* The RSC+ Preservation community (especially RSC 2001, Logg, 1e Luis)
  recorded many packet captures, without which a lot of information
  used to write this code would be lost.
