Why 10th December 2001?
=======================

10th December 2001 corresponds to mudclient110.

RSCSundae has this as its target for several reasons:

- This is the last versions of the RS Classic game before the
  introduction of pay-to-play.
  It contains the well-balanced free-to-play content that people love
  and remember best.
- It is the last client version that included the full
  server-side spawn and NPC behaviour data, allowing
  extremely accurate replication.

Content included in mudclient110
--------------------------------

### Regions

Asgarnia, Misthalin, Al Kharid, the Wilderness, Crandor,
and the area around Karamja Volcano are available and basically
fully complete, with some caveats.

There is a Mining Guild, Cooking Guild, Prayer Guild, and Champions' Guild.
There is no Crafting Guild, since this was originally pay-to-play
content (gold rocks are therefore more spread around the map,
making things a bit more balanced).

The Wilderness contains the graveyard, eastern Chaos Temple, Bone Yard,
Chaos Dwarf mine, Chaos Ridge, Hobgoblin mine, ruined village,
lava maze, Greater Demon ruins, sapphire house, and Ice Plateau.
The Dark Warrior Castle, Bandit Camp, and overgrown village are sadly
missing since they were originally pay-to-play - they look cool, but
aren't extremely useful.

There is no bank in Al Kharid.  This means the furnace closest
to an item bank is in Falador - just like when Bluerose13x was getting
99 Smithing.

There is no Tutorial Island. You're immediately spawned
adventure-ready in the game world, next to a Guide character (who
you can choose to ignore).  Most players will probably welcome this. :)

### Items

Items can be exchanged for certificates at Draynor Village market.

The best-in-slot food was Swordfish (heals 14 Hits in one bite) and
Anchovy pizza (heals 16 Hits in two bites).
Swordfish are technically tied with Pumpkins.

Runite equipment is fully available.  The most powerful weapons
(battle axe, 2-handed sword) require high level Smithing to create.
Runite rocks could only be found in the deep Wilderness.

Rune helmets can be obtained as drop from demons.  Shields must be
acquired through Smithing.  Other runite equipment can be purchased
from the Champions' Guild.

There are three ranged weapons, the shortbow, the longbow, and
the crossbow.  The longbow can be used at a greater distance
and was more accurate, but the crossbow hits harder.
The phoenix crossbow was the same as the regular crossbow.

Strength Potions are the only drinkable potion - they can be acquired
by bringing ingredients to the Apothecary in Varrock.  A small Defense
boost can be acquired by eating the magical cabbages growing at Draynor
Manor.

Disks of Returning could be purchased from Thordur's tourist
attraction in the Dwarven Mines.

Half full wine jugs could be found in the Chaos Temple north
of Goblin Village.

There were no sleeping bags since there was no Fatigue.

There were no priest robes since these were introduced with the
Biohazard quest in 2002 and originally pay-to-play only.
You can get monk robes from the prayer guild.

There was only one pickaxe type, since tiered pickaxes were introduced
with Fatigue.

The only discontinued items in-game were pumpkins, which are
basically just for fun and not wearable status symbols.

### Skills

The playable non-combat skills at this date were:
Prayer, Magic, Cooking, Woodcutting, Firemaking, Crafting,
Smithing, Mining

Mining and Smithing were basically fully complete at this date.
You can't make ranged ammunition since there's no Fletching skill
(broken by prototype darts in 2003 anyway, and bow strings broke
the Crafting skill).

Cooking and Fishing contain fish up to Swordfish (no sharks),
pizzas up to Anchovy (no pineapple), wine, cakes, bread,
stews, and meat.  Cooking is fairly grounded and the popular
content was there.

Crafting was almost fully complete besides dragonstones,
unholy symbols, and and glass making.  Besides dragonstones,
this is fairly unpopular content.  Pottery, leatherworking,
wool spinning, gem cutting, and silver/gold moulding are all there.

Woodcutting consists of pointy, round, and unhealthy trees.
They all give the same scaled experience (like Firemaking).
There was no "unhealthy trees give more experience" bug since
that bug was introduced with the Fletching skill.

Magic goes up to Fire Blast (level-59; death-rune spell).
Since it should stop being possible to fail to cast it
around level-70, there wasn't much reason to train Magic further.
Death-Runes are available from the muddy key chest in the
Wilderness and as a very rare drop from certain monsters.
Chaos-Runes are much more common but still quite rare.
Most RS Classic players believe this system was more balanced,
since the fully accurate damage at higher levels is more limited.

Prayer is fully complete.

### Other

There was no makeover mage.  This is unfortunate, and will
be worked around with a server-side command to let players
re-design their characters.

Monsters did not lose aggressiveness - this changed on
23 October 2002.  Mining at certain sites was more difficult
on low level characters due to this.

Worlds could hold a maximum of 1000 players at a time.
