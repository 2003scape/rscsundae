* Smithing a woodcutting axe (does it say 'axe' or 'hatchet'?)
* Trying to cut webs with staves, bows, and other objects
* "Not high enough level" messages for cooking and other non-crafting skills
* Dropping wine of zamorak near Monks of Zamorak and attempting to pick it up
* Attempting to pick up the steel mace drop from a Monk of Zamorak
* Trying to complete Cook's Assistant or make bread with a heap of flour
* String an unstrung holy symbol
