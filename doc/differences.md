Differences
===========

Between RSC Sundae and modern RuneScape
---------------------------------------

* Trading is harder (you need to meet other players in person), so...
** Most items are easier to obtain by making them yourself or buying them
   from a NPC.
** Trading with other players is mostly done for bulk items.
* The experience reward from quest scales with level, so...
** It is better to do quests with monetary rewards early on, and
   quests with experience rewards later.
* Some of the best items can only be obtained through high-level crafting
  and smithing (or trading with a player who has created them).
* High level runes are rare.  Anything other than the most basic low level
  runes can only be obtained through monster drops or various sources in 
  the Wilderness (such as the muddy chest).
* There are no bank notes.  Certain items can be exchanged for bulk
  certificates at Draynor Village's market.
* There are no negative equipment bonuses - you can cast spells while
  wearing full plate armour in the heat of battle.
* There are no variable weapon speeds - the best weapons are 2-handed
  swords and battle axes.
* There is no "combat triangle". Ranged and Magic are accessories to
  melee combat.
* Many monsters are higher level than in later games. You might
  want to start out fighting rats, spiders, or chickens before moving
  on to higher level monsters.
* You must retreat from melee combat before consuming food.  You can
  only retreat after a minimum of three rounds of melee combat.
* There is no "run" option. Things are generally spaced closer together.
* PvP combat is restricted to the Wilderness.


Between RSC Sundae and OpenRSC (RSC Preservation)
-------------------------------------------------

* Content is implemented only using original Runescript functions
  and original data sources.  Since Sundae is written from scratch,
  it contains no legacy private server code.  We used RSC+ Replays and
  packet captures from the original server from the start. All skilling
  rates in Sundae have been audited, so there are no leftover guessed
  rates.
* Pay-to-play content is not implemented.
* There are no discontinued items.
* Shop prices use the original formula from before 2009, when the game
  was at its peak in popularity.
* NPC spawns and behaviour are modelled accurately as they were in the
  original game, instead of being best-effort guesses.
* Instead of making bow strings being the fastest XP from level 10
  crafting until 99, it is best to make a variety of jewelry from
  silver, gold, and whatever gems you can find.
* There is no bank in Al Kharid (it was added after the release of
  pay-to-play). The closest furnace to a bank is in Falador.
* There is no Fatigue system.  You are not required to enter CAPTCHAs.
* There is only one type of pickaxe.
* Some mines contain different types of rocks, since the mines were
  rebalanced after Fatigue was released.
* There are slightly fewer buildings with beds in the game, since more
  were added after Fatigue was released.
** However, there are more trees as a result.
* The Dwarven Mines have two entrances instead of three -
  one near Falador's eastern bank, and one north of Falador.
